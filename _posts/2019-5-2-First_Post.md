It's a little chilly out today and the air is moist. We're working on our "websites" right now  using this barryclark's jekyll-now. It's fairly simple, and great way to get started. I've never actually posted on any blogs, but as I'm writing (well, typing), I can see the value in it. Not only to share your own ideas, but hightlighting anything valuable to yourself. That freedom to genuinely share yourself is a powerful priviledge I, or we all, should really exercise more often. 

I'm currently attending a Data Science Bootcamp. It's been a challenging experience, and I've learned a lot about data of course, but more about myself. It's the first time I haven't been a part of the work force and it's liberating. As much as I do have my qualms about institutionalized education, I do love being in a classroom and learning. If it paid the bills to attend classes, I'd take that offer up right now. Perhaps my negative feelings about 'working', is about the jobs I've had and 'work' I've done. Regardless, rediscovering my love of learning new things has been wonderful. I invite you all to discover or rediscover your love for the world. 

Share yourselves to the world!


Next you can update your site name, avatar and other options using the _config.yml file in the root of your repository (shown below).

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/config.png)

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
